# MatchaPour
Your new favorite mobile Matcha Game!
Matcha Pour is a cozy, timing-based game where players pour the perfect cup of matcha by tilting a teapot and filling an adorable teacup to just the right level. Too little or too much and it’s game over! ☕️

I built this game using SpriteKit in Swift, adding custom sound effects, progress tracking, animated pouring, and even a little puff of steam when the matcha hits the sweet spot. Inspired by the relaxing vibes of tea time (and a slight obsession with aesthetic game design), Matcha Pour blends gameplay and cuteness into a satisfying mini-game.
